Orchestra is a composable WPF shell and framework built on top of [Catel](http://www.catelproject.com).

It has been in active development for over 5 years (initial commit 2012/06/18) and is used in numerous Line of Business (LoB) applications on a daily basis.

Orchestra consists of a main shell including an SDK with services that allow developers to communicate with the shell.

## Goals

Provide a robust yet flexible LOB shell, designed with best practices in mind, to jump start the development of desktop applications.

In other words, we wanted to create a shell that dramatically speeds up the time it takes to release a LOB application to market by enabling developers to concentrate more on the business logic and less on scaffolding.

## Available Shells

Orchestra provides support for two different shells:

- Fluent ribbon
- MahApps

|  Fluent ribbon shell                                       | MahApps shell                                   |

## Orchestra + module features

We purposely designed Orchestra to be a lightweight shell. However you can 'super charge' it with the following open source libraries:
(We use all these libraries with Orchestra. In fact they were designed to work seamlessly with Orchestra. Hint: the libraries all start with Orc.*)

- License management ([Orc.LicenseManager](https://github.com/Orcomp/Orc.LicenseManager))
- Project management ([Orc.ProjectManagement](https://github.com/Orcomp/Orc.ProjectManagement))
- Automatic updates ([Orc.NuGetExplorer](https://github.com/WildGums/Orc.NuGetExplorer) [Orc.Squirrel](https://github.com/Orcomp/Orc.Squirrel))
- Undo/Redo ([Orc.Memento](https://github.com/WildGums/Orc.Memento))
