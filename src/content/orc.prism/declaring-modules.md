When developing a module in Prism, most of the time you need a base class for all the models that contain the IoC container, `IRegionManager` and more. To make development with prism and Catel as easy as possible, the `ModuleBase` is included with Orc.Prism.Â There are two versions of the `ModuleBase` available, which are described below.

## Generic ModuleBase

The generic module base allows the end-developer to decide what IoC container is used. For example, the developer has the choice whether the `ServiceLocator` or any other IoC container such as Unity or MEF is used.

### Defining a module

Defining a module is very simple. Just create a new class with the `ModuleBase` as base class.

```
public class MyModule : ModuleBase<IServiceLocator>
{
	public MyModule()
		: base("My module", ServiceLocator.Instance.ResolveType<IModuleTracker>(), ServiceLocator.Instance)
	{ 
	}

	protected override T GetService<T>()
	{
		return Container.ResolveType<T>();
	}
}
```
	
### Handling code when the module is initialized

The `ModuleBase` contains convenience methods when the module is initialized. Simple override the `OnInitializing` or `OnInitialized` methods.

## Non-generic ModuleBase

The non-generic base uses the `ServiceLocator` as default IoC container. This class derives from the generic module base and specifies the `ServiceLocator` as IoC container.
